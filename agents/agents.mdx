Agentic workflows are AI-driven processes that can independently plan, execute, and refine multi-step tasks to achieve specific objectives. Unlike traditional rule-based automation, these workflows adapt dynamically, learning from data and user interactions to improve performance over time.

## Agentic Tools from LandingAI
LandingAI offers the following agentic solutions:

- VisionAgent: Use this tool to generate Visual AI code from prompts. VisionAgent selects the best models for your vision tasks, so you can build vision-enabled apps in minutes.
- Agentic Object Detection: This is an industry-leading zero-shot object detection app that identifies highly specific items, like “gaming chair” or “green shoe” with a text prompt. It returns a list of bounding boxes with normalized coordinates and label names. 
- Agentic Document Extraction: Use this app to extract structured information from visually complex documents with text, tables, pictures, charts, and other information. The API returns the extracted data in a hierarchical format and pinpoints the exact location of each element.
