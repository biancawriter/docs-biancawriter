  We're excited to launch Agentic Document Extraction! 
  Unlike traditional OCR methods, Agentic Document Extraction takes a document, breaks it down into individual component pieces, and uses reasoning to examine and connect the components. This takes into account the document layout and visual elements, and not just the text.

Whether you're dealing with medical forms, financial reports, or research flowcharts, Agentic Document Extraction delivers unparalleled accuracy and insights.
