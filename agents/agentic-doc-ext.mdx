---
The Agentic Document Extraction API is a tool that can extract structured information out of documents with different layouts. It returns the extracted data in a structured hierarchical format containing text, tables, pictures, charts, and other information.

You can send documents to the Agentic Document Extraction API through our web-based app here. You can also programmatically send documents using the Python, JavaScript, and cURL commands available in the app.

The Agentic Document Extraction API is built on VisionAgent, the agentic framework from LandingAI.
