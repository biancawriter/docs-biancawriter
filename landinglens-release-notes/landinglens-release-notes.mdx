<Update label="February 11, 2025" description="v0.1.1">
  The newest version of LandingLens features a redesigned confusion matrix! The new confusion matrix is a table that shows ground truth labels versus model predictions. This new table format empowers you to quickly see what classes the model is predicting correctly, and which ones it might have trouble identifying.

Each cell shows the count of instances that correspond to particular ground truth class-predicted class pair. For example, in the image below, the model correctly predicted the class "Hard Hat" 32 times and misclassified it 2 times.
