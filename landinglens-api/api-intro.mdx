LandingLens API is a RESTful API that allows you to use [LandingLens](https://app.landing.ai/) programmatically. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the LandingLens API to programmatically perform many tasks in LandingLens, including:

- Create projects
- Upload images to projects
- Create classes
- Train models
- Deploy models to cloud-endpoints hosted by LandingAI (cloud deployment)
