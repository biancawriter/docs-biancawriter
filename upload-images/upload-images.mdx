After you create a project, upload images to it. LandingLens will train a model based on the images you upload and label.

## Supported File types

## Image size
For Object Detection, Classification, and Visual Prompting projects, you can upload images that are up to 100MP. However, images larger than 36MP will load very slowly in the user interface.

For Segmentation projects, you can upload images that are up to 36MP.

All image size maximums are based on the number of pixels (and not based on image file size).
