This section is from [Load Images with Sync Snowflake Data](https://support.landing.ai/docs/load-images-from-snowflake#load-images-with-sync-snowflake-data).
After granting LandingLens access to the stage with the images you want to load into LandingLens, you can load those images into a LandingLens project.
1. Open the project you want to load images to.
2. Click **Sync Snowflake Data**.
    <img height="200" src="/images/SyncSFData_1(1).png" />
3. Enter the **database**, **schema**, and **stage** that have the images you want to load into LandingLens. The drop-downs automatically populate based on the locations that you created or have access to.
4. Click the directory path (`âŒ„ /`) in the **Folder** box. Use this field to navigate to and select a directory on the Snowflake stage.
    - If you select the root directory (or don't select any directory), supported images from the stage and its directories will be loaded into LandingLens.
    - If you want to load images from only a specific directory, select that directory.
5. Click **Sync**.
6. Images from the stage (or the selected directories) are loaded to the LandingLens project in batches. The page refreshes every 10 seconds to display new images until all are loaded.
